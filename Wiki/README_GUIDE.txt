the main README.md file found at the project root.

Contents of This Folder

The main README.md file is designed to provide a high-level summary,
but these text documents aim to give developers and analysts a
more detailed view of:

  - Setup requirements and configuration
  - Usage examples and flow
  - Component-level descriptions
  - Debugging help and reporting issues

------------------------------------------------------------
